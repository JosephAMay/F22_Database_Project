# F22_Database_Project - Library Database 
This project aims to replicate a databse like a library would have. This includes the typical catalog that a libray would have, books, movies, records etc, and also data on library card holders, library employees, and affiliated libraries.

Once the library tables have been created we wil create a series of useful queries typical users would want from the database. Queries are tailored for 3 types of users

1. A library card holder, who needs to do things like lookup an item to if it can be borrowed, see what they have borrowed currently, when an item is due to be returned. 
2. A library employee, who needs to check when an item is over due and assign appropriate fees, check the availability of an item, assess returned items for damage, see if another library has an item for an inter-library loan
3. A manager, who needs to be able to check addresses of employees, alter salaries.
